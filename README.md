# Panels Collectible Items Example
An example [Panels](https://github.com/cadin/panels) project showing how to use [global variables](https://cadin.github.io/panels/docs/comic-data/variables.html) to create a comic with persistent collectible items.


## Setup

This project includes the Panels framework as a git submodule. Be sure to properly [initialize the submodule](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/git/how-to-clone-including-submodules.html) when cloning the repo.

If you're not using git, you can download this code as a ZIP file. In that case you'll also need to download the code from the [Panels repo](https://github.com/cadin/panels) and place it in the `source/libraries/panels/` folder of this template.
